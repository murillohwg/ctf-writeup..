## Challenge Overview

When opening the challenge, the website displayed a very simple HTML page containing a short text about Histiaeus.

At first glance, nothing suspicious appeared on the page itself.

The challenge behavior suggested that the flag might be hidden somewhere in the webpage source.

## Initial Analysis

The page looked completely normal:

- Basic HTML structure
- No forms or inputs
- No JavaScript functionality
- No visible hidden content

Since this was a beginner web challenge, the next logical step was to inspect the page source.

## Viewing the Source Code

Using:

```bash
CTRL + U
```

(or manually accessing `view-source:`)

I inspected the HTML source code of the page.

Near the bottom of the file, there was an HTML comment containing the flag.

The following comment revealed the flag:

```html
<!--picoCTF{in5p3t0r_0f_h7ml_8113f7e2}-->
```

## Flag

```txt
picoCTF{in5p3t0r_0f_h7ml_8113f7e2}
```

## What This Challenge Teaches

This challenge demonstrates a very common beginner concept in Web Exploitation:

> Always inspect the source code.

Developers sometimes leave sensitive information inside:

- HTML comments
- JavaScript files
- Hidden elements
- Metadata
- Debug information

Even when nothing is visible on the webpage itself.
