# WriteUp - heap dump
> Web Explotation - API misconfiguration

## Challenge Description

This challenge explore a web application and find an endpoint that exposes a file containing a hidden flag.

Hints:

* Explore backend development with us
* The head was dumped

## Enumeration

### Homepage Analysis

The challenge presents a simple news website called **picoCTF News**.

While browsing the website, one article references API documentation, suggesting that additional functionality may be available through backend endpoints.

### Source Code Review

Inspecting the page source revealed references to API-related resources and documentation.

This indicated that the application exposes a backend API that could be explored further.

### API Documentation Discovery

Navigating to the API documentation endpoint exposed a Swagger interface.

The Swagger page listed several available endpoints, including routes for managing blog posts and diagnostic functionality.

### Endpoint Enumeration

Reviewing the available API routes revealed the following modules:

* `/api/posts`
* `/api/posts/{id}`
* `/heapdump`

The endpoint `/heapdump` immediately stood out because of the challenge hint:

> The head was dumped.

This strongly suggested that a memory dump might be exposed.

## Exploitation

### Accessing the Heap Dump

The `/heapdump` endpoint was accessed directly.

The server responded by generating a downloadable file named:

```text
heapdump.heapsnapshot
```

Heap snapshots are commonly used in Node.js applications for debugging memory issues. However, exposing them publicly can leak sensitive information stored in memory.

### Inspecting the Dump

After downloading the heap snapshot, the file was inspected locally.

Using simple string searches against the dump revealed sensitive application data stored in memory.

Example:

```bash
grep -a "picoCTF{" heapdump
```

This quickly located the flag embedded within the heap snapshot contents.

## Flag Retrieval

Searching through the heap dump revealed the flag.

## Root Cause

The application exposed a diagnostic endpoint that generated a heap snapshot of the running Node.js process.

Heap dumps frequently contain:

* API keys
* Session tokens
* User information
* Secrets
* Application state
* Flags (in CTF environments)

Because the endpoint was publicly accessible, an attacker could download the server's memory contents and extract sensitive information without authentication.

## Concepts 

* Debugging endpoints should never be exposed to untrusted users.
* Heap snapshots may contain highly sensitive information.
* Swagger documentation can reveal hidden functionality and administrative routes.
* Publicly accessible diagnostic endpoints can lead to severe information disclosure vulnerabilities.

## Flag

```text
picoCTF{REDACTED}
```
